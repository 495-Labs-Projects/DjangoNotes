# DjangoNotes
A bunch of random notes for using Django (setup, requirements, testing, building simple app, etc.)

### Development Notes
When editing or adding to the notes, please only make changes to the markdown (.md) files. The html pages are auto generated using the Sublime package called Markdown Preview.
